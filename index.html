        <h1>What a Credit Card “Assistant” Actually Does</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">
          Many banking apps now talk about “assistants” or “smart helpers” for your card. This page explains
          what sits behind those labels – and how to use them without switching off your own judgment.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Card Assistant?</h2>
      <p>
        A card assistant is a feature inside a banking app, wallet app or third-party service that adds an
        extra “layer” on top of your credit card. Instead of just showing static statements, it tries to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explain transactions and fees in plain language.</li>
        <li>Highlight actions you may want to take (like paying before interest is charged).</li>
        <li>Surface patterns in your spending or card use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some assistants use simple rules and notifications. Others combine rules with AI models to answer questions
        in normal language or generate tailored summaries of your situation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Features / use cases -->
    <section id="features" class="section">
      <h2>Common Features in Card Assistants</h2>
      <p>
        Not every assistant offers the same set of tools, but many include variations of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Statement explanations:</strong> breaking down your monthly bill into categories and
          explaining line items like “cash advance fee” or “FX mark-up”.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Due-date reminders:</strong> nudging you before payment deadlines so you have time to move money.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spending insights:</strong> grouping spend by merchant, country, category or time period.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scenario views:</strong> showing how the balance changes if you pay only the minimum vs. a higher amount.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security alerts:</strong> flagging unusual transactions or logins so you can react quickly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is usually not to “beat the system”, but to make it easier to see the mechanics of how your card
        behaves month to month.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Limits & risks -->
    <section id="limits" class="section">
      <h2>Limits, Bias and Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        A card assistant can be useful – but it has clear limits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>It does not change your contract:</strong> the official terms and fee tables from the issuer still rule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>It can be wrong or incomplete:</strong> especially when using AI to summarise complex conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>It may be opinionated:</strong> “suggestions” might reflect business goals (like promoting certain products).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>It requires data access:</strong> check how your transaction data is stored, used and potentially shared.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Treat any assistant as a tool for visibility – not an autopilot for financial decisions. If something looks off,
        always cross-check against the raw statement or contact the issuer directly.
